        <p>
          Hello, I’m <strong>Andres Saladrigas, Producer</strong> of Broken Gem Studios and The HacknSlash game The Witcher: Ties of Destiny. 
          During this project I have been responsible for delivering <strong>a good product</strong> while we created a fully functional video game engine. 
          As a Team, we developed not just the game, but the tools needed for its development as well. 
        </p>
        <p>
          During these 4 months, I <strong>supervised the development process</strong> by analyzing our current goals and external factors, synthesizing actual information 
          and assets in order to provide a better schedule and working environment. <strong>Adaptation and flexibility</strong> in our working structure was crucial. We were 
          able to follow the project development process with better results while facing many difficulties in the journey. 
        </p>
        <p>
          As a part of my job, I took the lead in the <strong>monitoring and control of the team member’s tasks and objectives.</strong> To select each member´s 
          activities and objectives I kept in mind how to achieve better goals and how to enhance skills where the individual had shown clear potentialweb, 
          leading to a more satisfactory result. Selecting correct responsibilities and needs was essential in order for each team to shine in their own way in our project.
        </p>
        <p>
          As part of my job I <strong>set up and created social meetings and group mechanics</strong> to keep the team organized. When the Pandemic changed our working environment 
          I needed to develop new working dynamics that played a substantial role in our daily activities, using available tools such as HacknPlan, Google Drive and Discord to create a working server.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Global Crisis was a huge challenge that we successfully went through. <strong>Constant communication</strong> was key. I meet <strong>with Team members</strong> in order to hear out their obstacles, problems and help them in 
          order to raise the team’s morale and effectiveness. Each individual emotionality affects the whole team morale as emotions are contagious. Being flexible had a huge impact as 
          members were sometimes unavailable and constant redistribution of the work was necessary to achieve the objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Communication was the changing factor. Keeping an easy channel made the difference. <strong>Minimizing and solving personal conflicts</strong> between team members and helping the 
          resolution of them ensures the efficiency of the team. <strong>Negotiation and mediation</strong> was also a necessary part of my job and negotiating with team members, 
          product owners and the university was crucial to get the expected results.
        </p>
