        <p>
          I’m Dídac Romero, coder and lead of the small audio team. Games and audio are probably
          my biggest passions, and in this project I was able to contribute to both. For the most part of
          the project I have been one of the coders of Broken Engine and at the latest stages of the
          project I got to lead the small audio team, whilst also developing some gameplay code for
          The Witcher: Ties of Destiny.
        </p>
          <p>
            My role in the code team has been to develop the scripting system of the engine, based on
            Lua. It’s important to note that in a previous subject we would develop a game engine in
            pairs or individually. This game engine had just the basics to start implementing the different
            subsystems an engine would have, and we would implement 1 subsystem. My colleague
            Carles Homs and I chose the scripting system, and we chose to use Lua because we liked
            the idea of messing around an interpreted language that was different to what we were
            accustomed to code with.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the scripting system coder I began my journey on improving the rudimentary scripting
            system in order to make life easier to everyone who would be using it on Broken Engine.   
          </p>
          <p>
            A new approach: As a student, I’m always trying to think every bit of what I’m going to code
            and develop it from scratch. This skill was very helpful when I wouldn’t find much
            documentation on how to build a scripting system in Lua, but from now on everything was
            different, I had to be fast to give quality of life improvements to my colleagues coding in Lua.
          </p>
          <p>
            My new approach has been to try to integrate or use external tools that would have taken a
            lot of time to develop. This way the team had quality tools and improvements that reduced
            the time needed to develop scripts.
          </p>
          <h4><strong>PROJECT CONTRIBUTION</strong></h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Scripting System & Improvements:</strong> I developed the whole scripting system of Broken
              Engine, from the management of the pipeline during execution to the hot reloading
              capabilities and the basic functionalities for the display and edition of variables from the
              inspector</li>
            <li><strong>Script Debugging:</strong> Browsing through many libraries and solutions for this issue I choose to
              implement some code to support the usage of the Zero Brane Studio IDE, which is a Lua
              centered IDE with all capabilities necessary to debug any script. We basically attach the Lua
              virtual machine to the IDE that can then use all its prepared code to properly manage
              debugging.</li>
            <li><strong>Autocomplete:</strong> Since everyone used Visual Studio Code to code scripts for the game, I
              developed a small autocomplete functionality that uses the KeyRing plugin from the VSCode
              marketplace (a tool made by the modding community of Warcraft) to display the functions
              that can be called to alter the state of the game. Unfortunately the system required to be
              manually updated, and I would love to improve in this area by using some sort of code
              reflection library in the future as a personal project.</li>
            <li><strong>Callbacks: </strong> The engine had to support many callback functionalities for all kind of
              subsystems such as UI, or more complex callbacks such as physics events like collisions
              and triggers. I developed a simple way to make callbacks from any system and helped the
              different subsystem programmers to implement the functionality in their pipeline in a safe
              and effective way.</li>
            <li><strong>Script to script communication: </strong> Using the Lua bridge wrapper I found a way to pass
              complete scripts as reference to other scripts that requested them, giving them full access to
              the public members and functions, which were updated at all times since it was a direct
              reference.
              </li>
            <li><strong>Lua to C++ “translator”:</strong> I developed an utility that allows the engine to use custom types
              such as vector 3 or quaternions previously defined in a Lua document, and properly parse
              and change or use its data. This was notoriously good to avoid code repetition and make
              sure you could define functions to dump engine information into newly created lua tables and
              vice versa, allowing the engine programmers to create functions to fully customize what they
              wanted to do with those data structures. Furthermore, this system allowed the creation of
              local memory in lua that could be referenced later in other scripts, whilst allowing the
              gameplay programers the possibility to access these vectors or quaternions by typing for
              instance vector.x instead of vector[1].</li>
            <li><strong>Gamepads Support:</strong> At the beginning of the project I implemented the gamepad support for
              gamepads and all its related scripting functionalities so that the gameplay programmers can
              use all of the capabilities implemented in the engine related to gamepads.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio System Collaboration:</strong> Although Jacobo has been our audio programmer, I helped
              him in the implementation of Wwise RTPC’s or loading multiple soundbank files and
              designing a system to use the fastest way to communicate with wwise (UID’s) while using
              readable references to those UID’s by using strings, which were defined in various json files
              you can generate from Wwise.</li>
            <li><strong>Audio Team coordination:</strong> Towards the last month and a half of development the leads
              and the producer created a small audio team (3-4 people) and I got the charge of leading the
              team. The team was created to implement and redesign some of the audio aspects of the
              game in order to fix the lack of audio the whole project had been suffering.</li>
            <li><strong>Selection and implementation of Music:</strong> Since I really like music in games I got the
              charge to choose royalty free music that would fit the game’s theme, ambience and
              ambitions in terms of audio design. I also implemented the system of interactive music that
              plays throughout both levels and the voiceline system for characters and enemies simple
              lore, although some stuff on the enemies had to be rolled back in order to polish in a better
              way the most important aspects of the game’s audio.</li>
          </ul>
