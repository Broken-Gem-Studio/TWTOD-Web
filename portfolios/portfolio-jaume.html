        <p>
          I’m Jaume and I’ve been working as a designer and gameplay programmer for this project during these past four months.       
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact of assuming these roles made me realise some important points. The design work we did in the very first steps of this project was a very good base. 
          But even though, starting the game itself made us realise that we had an overwhelming amount of work. As a solution, we re-designed much of the game design document content, 
          which had to be updated lots of times during the development. 
        </br>
        In addition to these issues, the Game Engine was in constant progress, meaning that we did not have the tools to create what we wanted until later versions of the Engine.
        </br>
        I’ve learned new skills while being a gameplay programmer, such as working in a new environment (Broken Engine), learning lua programming language and applying that knowledge into designing and programming a whole new enemy for the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working all my career in small teams (3-7 people) this has been the first time in such a big group. This made me re-discover the meaning of a 
          fluid communication and its importance between departments in big teams like Broken Gem Studio. 
          I feel very comfortable as a gameplay programer and I’m open to try other roles in a development team.
        </p>
          <h4><strong>PROJECT CONTRIBUTION</strong></h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Design Document:</strong> As all my teammates, I practically touched all areas in the GDD. But I focused my work on the full design of a playable character “Ciri” and a progression system in which i worked on enemy stats, objects, levels, difficulties etc...	</li>
            <li><strong>Gameplay programming:</strong> I designed and fully programmed my own enemy called Lumberjack and also worked with the character programmer to make the combat with the enemy to feel nice. I also did lot of entity bug and behaviour fixing during the project to adapt to what i was asked for.             </li>
            <li><strong>Q&A and Feedback:</strong> With the combat scrum team I implemented the previously designed feedback for the combat such as particles and shaders. Lot of testing was necessary to balance the enemy combat and feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>CM:</strong> I’ve been managing the team social media and updating its content regularly.</li>
          </ul>
