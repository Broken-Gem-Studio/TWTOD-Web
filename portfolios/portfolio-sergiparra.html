        <p>
          Hello my name is Sergi Parra and I have mainly worked in this project
          as an engine programmer, as well as working in code quality control for most of the
          engine’s codebase, overseeing most additions to it. In all, I have been really involved
          with the development of our engine.
        </p>
          <h4><strong>PROJECT CONTRIBUTION</strong></h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Multithreading Module:</strong>In order to be able to undertake big processing tasks in less time I
              created a multithreading module that created worker threads and put them in a thread pool
              that constantly crunches any tasks given to it. This module also has the option to halt (and
              use) the main thread until all tasks are completed.</li>
            <li><strong>Build System / .dll Structure:</strong> In order to be able to build our games from the engine, I
              changed how our code compiled: making the core functionality of the engine into a library
              (dll) and then having to executables that link the dll, one for the engine, and for the games.
              And then I created a panel for the engine that would copy all needed files and set up the
              configuration of the build.</li>
            <li><strong>Recast Navigation System:</strong> In order for our enemies to pathfind around the map, we
              decided to implement Mikko Mononen’s Recast Navigation system into our engine. At first
              this was implemented in a single chunk way, but then later was changed to create the mesh
              in chunks which were then created each in parallel using multithreading. I also decided to
              create an interface that, not unlike Unity’s, allowed you to create up to 30 areas with custom
              names and area costs, as well as edit the settings of your mesh before baking it.</li>
            <li><strong>Optick Addition:</strong> Together with Aitor Simona, we added Optick into our codebase to
              measure the performance of our engine and game under stress, I also added a compiling 
              option for our engine that disables Optick outright, to avoid the overhead.</li>
            <li><strong>Post-processing and OpenGL fixes:</strong> Lucho Suaya, Aitor Simona and I worked on the
              engine’s graphical side, fixing bugs related to it as well as adding some post-processing
              effects, including HDR, Bloom and Color Correction with a color look-up table (LUT).</li>
            <li><strong>Port to x64:</strong> As the game’s development advanced, and our Art department made bigger
              and more detailed meshes and textures, we realized that the 2GB of RAM that the engine’s
              x86 structure allowed us was not enough. So, I ported all of the engine libraries and the
              engine itself to x64, adding some scripts that automatically switch dlls to x86 or x64 as
              needed when compiling the engine so we could still fall back to the x86 version.</li>
            <li><strong>Toon Shader and Outline:</strong> I created a toon shader with the same capabilities that our
              standard shader has, that would make lights and shadows work in customizable steps to
              approach the more toony style that we wanted to make our game have. To go with the toon
              shader, I also developed an outline system for materials, indendent of the shader used,
              which can work either/or when behind or in front of geometry and have different colors for
              each situation.</li>
            <li><strong>QA:</strong> I oversaw most Pull Requests into the engine codebase, ensuring that they worked in
              the engine and the game and that they were up to our standards.</li>
          </ul>
